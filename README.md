Mila: The Mindful, Interactive Lifestyle Assistant

## Getting Started
Before running `main.py`, you'll need to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `DISCORD_TOKEN` in the environment variables. One way to do this is with `direnv` and an `.envrc` file. The file's contents will look like this:

```
export DISCORD_TOKEN="{discord token goes here}"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="{openai api key goes here}"
```

With the environment variables in-place, simply run `main.py`.
